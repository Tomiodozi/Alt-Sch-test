Echo is a simple command that displays lines of text in the terminal.

With ps command, you can take a look at the processes your current session is running. It prints useful information about the programs you’re running, like process ID, time, and command name.

If you’re struggling to remember a command, history comes in handy. This command displays a list with the commands you’ve used in the past.

The exit command does exactly what its name suggests: With it, you can end a shell session and, in most cases, automatically close the terminal you’re using.

The whoami command (short for “who am i”) displays the username currently in use.

Another essential Linux command is man. It displays the manual page of any other command (as long as it has one).
To see the manual page of the mkdir command, type.

This command stands for “superuser do,” and it lets you act as a superuser or root user while you’re running a specific command. It’s how Linux protects itself and prevents users from accidentally modifying the machine’s filesystem or installing inappropriate packages.
Sudo is commonly used to install software or to edit files outside the user’s home directory:

htop is an interactive process viewer that lets you manage your machine’s resources directly from the terminal. In most cases, it isn’t installed by default, so make sure to read more about it on its download page.

uname(short for “Unix name”) prints the operative system information, which comes in handy when you know your current Linux version.
Most of the time, you’ll be using the -a (–all) flag, since the default output isn’t that useful:
